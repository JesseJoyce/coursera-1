			Stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes.The content to be added can be specified in several ways:
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="wrap">
		<div class="menu con2 "> 
			<div class="sup s2">Name2</div>
			by using git add to incrementally "add" changes to the index before using the commit command (Note: even modified files must be "added"); by using git rm to remove files from the working tree and the index, again before using the commit command; 
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="wrap lala">
		<div class="menu con3">
			<div class="sup s3">Name3</div>
			by listing files as arguments to the commit command (without --interactive or --patch switch), in which case the commit will ignore changes staged in the index, and instead record the current content of the listed files (which must already be known to Git); by using the -a switch with the commit command to automatically "add" changes from all known files (i.e. all files that are already listed in the index) and to automatically "rm" files in the index that have been removed from the working tree, and then perform the actual commit;
