		<h3 class="text-center">What Every Prospective Ferret Owner Needs to Know (because it's more interesting than sushi)</h3>

		<p>Ferrets are playful, active, curious and loving. They make wonderful pets, but before you fall in love with one at a pet store or rush off to get one after talking to a delighted ferret owner, there are a few things that you must consider.</p>

		<h4>Time</h4>
		<p>Ferrets make excellent pets for people who have the time for them, and who bond well with animals. Ferrets are naturally quiet, friendly, inquisitive, intelligent, and companionable. At certain points in the day, they are also exceedingly active and capable of getting themselves into trouble unless they are supervised. Their intelligence makes them interesting companions, and they are able to amuse themselves when you are not around. But they do require attention and interaction with their owners; their mental and physical health depends on it.</p>

		<h4>Legalities</h4>
		<p>City, county, state, or military regulations can all dictate whether or not it is legal for you to own, breed, or sell a ferret where you live. The regulations can be quite involved. California, for example, allows only neutered males to be kept; and in Carson City, Nevada, it is illegal to own a ferret if you have a small child in your household. To determine the regulations in your area, check with your local Wildlife or Fish and Game department, with the Humane Society, or with your local veterinarian. These organizations should also be able to advise you on license and permit requirements. Depending on where you live, you may need a license or permit for your ferret. The costs for this can range from free to $15 or more.</p>

		<h4>Costs</h4>
		<p>The purchase price of a ferret can vary widely, ranging from $65 to more than $250. But the cost of buying the animal is only part of your initial cost. In addition to the purchase price, you can expect to pay another $150 to $350 for vaccinations (including rabies), veterinary examinations, and basic supplies. You will also need to budget for spaying or neutering your new pet, so check with your veterinarian for costs before making your purchase decision. You may wish to consider purchasing an older, already altered animal in lieu of a young kit.</p>

		<p>Once you bring your new ferret home, you will need to budget for renewals of vaccinations, routine veterinary care, and applicable licenses. Your ferret will, of course, need food, plus you will need to regularly buy litter, deodorizing cleaners, over-the-counter medicines including hairball remedies, and vitamin supplements, shampoos, collars and leads, etc.</p>

		<h4>Compatibility</h4>
		<p>Many prospective ferret owners are naturally concerned about how well a ferret would get along with their children or other pets. A ferret is a demanding pet for a child, requiring careful adult supervision and the maturity of the child. The child must be able to recognize that a ferret behaves differently from a dog, cat, or other pet. The child must also be old enough to handle the responsibility of caring for the ferret. Ferrets are not recommended for a household with children younger than 6 or 7 years, and especially close supervision would be required around infants or babies.</p>

		<p>Because they are natural hunters, ferrets usually can't be trained to get along with birds, fish, rabbits, rodents, or lizards. If you have these animals in your home, you will need to provide vigilant supervision at all times. But ferrets can generally be trained to get along with cats and dogs. Note, however, that terriers and similar dogs were originally bred to hunt.</p>

		<p>If you have a dog or cat, you will want to introduce them to your ferret gradually, and vice versa. You will need two people, one to hold the cat or dog and one to hold the ferret. Allow your pets to smell each other while providing encouragement and reassurance-your cat or dog will be bewildered and anxious as well, so be certain to provide them with extra attention. Let the animals' behavior guide you. As they seem to accept each other, you can gradually allow them to interact freely under close supervision. Make certain, however, that the ferret has an escape route available. And no matter how well your pets seem to get along, you will want to be sure to continue to provide supervision when they are together. Feed them separately and be certain that you don't allow your ferret to play with your other animal's toys.</p>

		<h4>Aggressiveness</h4>
		<p>Ferrets must be taught not to nip or bite, much the same way that kittens and puppies are taught what behavior is appropriate. A domestically bred ferret will usually not be vicious or aggressive, but it is in its nature to enjoy games that simulate hunting, tug-of-war, chasing, or mock combat. A young ferret will not understand what hurts you and what doesn't hurt you until you communicate the boundaries. It will be up to you to establish those boundaries appropriately, without hurting your ferret or teaching it to fear or mistrust you.</p>

		<p>Some ferrets do respond to fear, pain, or to certain noises or actions by biting. The key to altering that behavior is to understand and eliminate the underlying reason. If it is a noise, eliminate the source of the noise. If it is some action on your part, try to assess your behavior from your ferret's point of view. Your ferret isn't doing it to be mean or with the intent to harm you.</p>
